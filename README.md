# T_Shirt Allocation
> In this project, I try to find a way to print t-shirts and allocate them to participants of an event

Imagine there was an event where attendees had to fill in a form, a part of the form required everyone to fill in their age, t-shirt size, colour, type, gender and an avatar to be printed on the t-shirt.

For this project I will create my own dummy dataset with all the info from attendees as I have tried to find a dataset with this information but did not win.

### TASKS
##### 1: Generate/Construct dataset
##### 2: Clean and Analyse data
##### 3: Sort data to solve the main problem (how to allocate t-shirts easier and faster)
##### 4: present the data on how the t-shirts can be printed
