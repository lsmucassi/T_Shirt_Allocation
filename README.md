# T_Shirt Allocation
> In this project, I try to find a way to print t-shirts and allocate them to participants of an event

Imagine there was an event where attendees had to fill in a form, a part of the form required everyone to fill in their:
- age, 
- t-shirt size, 
- colour, 
- type, 
- gender and 
- an avatar 
to be printed on the t-shirt.

For this project I will create my own dummy dataset with all the info from attendees as I have tried to find a dataset with this information but did not win.

### TASKS
##### 1: Generate/Construct dataset
1.1 Generate dataset
    I used this site to generate dummy data, I could have written code to do so but there really is no need to re-invent the wheel
    - https://www.mockaroo.com/
    - other sites that can be used to generate data for practice and fun sake
1.2 Merge datasets
    Because I did not have a premium account with Mockoroo so I had to cheat a bit, I generated 4 different datasets, now let's merge them to one data set. 

##### 2: Clean and Analyse data
##### 3: Sort data to solve the main problem (how to allocate t-shirts easier and faster)
##### 4: present the data on how the t-shirts can be printed - visualization
